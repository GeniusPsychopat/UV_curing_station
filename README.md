# Open-source UV curing station project

## the What?
UV curing station, made from cheap, "off-the-shelf" parts. Held together by bad soldering, plastic welding and my hopes and prayers. Fully open-source of course, but that isn't always a good thing is it?


## Why?
I am planning on getting a SLA 3d printer and I'm way too cheap to pay for an additional curing station. So I'm making my own open-source, jank filled, mess with a buggy code. With hookers!.. and blackjack!


## How?
I used to play with arduino when I was a bit younger, so I'm trying to coax an off-brand Nano into running my code. All the frame parts + the gearbox are made from FDM 3D printer (that's the one that uses plastic filament to fill our seas with plastic). And so far all the electronics have been from ALiexpress. God help us all.

I will try to include all the code, sketches/diagrams, .stl files, and anything else I can think of, so that someone could (no idea why) make himself his own.


## When?
In my free time mostly.. I do have a day job, plus wayyy to many responsibilities to make any promises to keep, but if I'm in the mood I'm gonna make some goddamn commits. I would like to finish by the end of September 25', cuz that's when I want to get the printer, but I may update the code from time to time afterwards.
